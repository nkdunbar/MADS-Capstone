Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) used for data ingestion, cleaning, training, modeling, prediction, and visualizations.

Notebooks have been saved with completed executions and rendered charts, for easy browsing. Saved notebooks do not always save completed renders.

Do not rely on GitHub's `.ipynb` renderer, since it will not render all types of outputs.

All notebooks are intended to be able to run start-to-finish, independently, in any order. Dependency installation is done via a library import.
